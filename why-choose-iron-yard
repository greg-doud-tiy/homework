_"Hey, my name is Jen and I've been doing some research on code schools in the area. HackerSchool is $2000 less than your program, and allows for part time. Why choose TIY?"

Well Jen, that may be an option for you if you can afford to do your learning part-time. At The Iron Yard, we focus on helping people that want to accelerate their learning because they want to become professional software developers as a career quickly and are willing to prioritize it by focusing on it full-time. Also, our instructors are the best in the industry and know what it takes to become a professional developer. The price for The Iron Yard may be a bit higher, but we believe we provide you the quality education and training to get you into that new career you want quickly and effectively.
